<font color="green">**About PAI Lab:**</font>

Inspired and guided by a Blue Sky workshop at the 2023 annual conference of the International Communication Association and an international "Meet the Lab" event in 2024, where I had the opportunities to moderate panels on which esteemed scholars like [Sun Joo (Grace) Ahn](https://grady.uga.edu/faculty/sun-joo-grace-ahn/), [Autumn Edwards](https://wmich.edu/communication/directory/edwards), [James Cummings](https://www.bu.edu/com/profile/jim-cummings/), [Tony Liao](https://dot.egr.uh.edu/departments/ilt/people/faculty/liao-tony), [Jih-Hsuan Tammy Lin](https://drtammylin.com/), [Sunny Liu](https://sml.stanford.edu/people/sunny-xun-liu), [Matthew Lombard](https://klein.temple.edu/directory/matthew-lombard-lombard), and [Astrid Rosenthal-von der Pütten](https://www.itec.rwth-aachen.de/cms/itec/der-lehrstuhl/team/~szbg/rosenthal-von-der-puetten-astrid/?allou=1&lidx=1) shared their invaluable experience of founding and managing research groups and spaces, I began to develop the <font color="green">Presence and Artificial Intelligence (PAI) Lab</font> in July 2023. Echoing the pronunciation and significance of “<font color="green">***π***</font>”, the PAI Lab stands for its commitment to exploring infinite possibilities for non-recurring emerging technology research.

This PAI Lab aims at conducting research on users’ relationships with a range of presence-evoking technologies, including social robots, virtual humans, chatbots, virtual influencers, smartwatches, memes, virtual reality, and augmented reality. The lab also delves into topics such as explainable AI (XAI), Science and Technology Studies (STS), and ubiquitous computing. 

Revolving around both the science and the methods of artificial intelligence, our lab seeks to conduct theoretically robust and methodologically innovative research, with the support of the technologies available in the lab space, including:\
*Aldebaran Robot NAO V6*\
*Double II Telepresence robot*\
*Meta Quest Pro*\
*UBTech Robot Alpha*\
*Robot Eilik*\
*Shimmer3 GSR+ Unit*\
*iMotions eye tracking device*\
\
\
Graduate students at the PAI Lab combine technology research with a variety of topics and contexts, including popular culture, public health, semiotics, and big data. Our lab members are:

Fanjue Liu is an asssitant professor in digital techonlogy and culture at Shanghai Jiao Tong University. She was a doctoral student at the University of Florida. Her research investigates how people perceive and interact socially with emerging technologies such as virtual humans. Specifically, she investigates how people use different psychological patterns to interact with virtual influencers, how the emergence of virtual influencers changes the dynamics of influencer marketing, and whether virtual influencers can be considered a viable substitute for human influencers.\
